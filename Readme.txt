This project is a web app that will analyze both team compositions and then give the user
the run down of what their teams win conditions are as well as their enemys win conditions are
as well as what to do to counter the enemy teams win conditions. 

This project will be built using both Python and JavaScript. 

The basic premis of this project is that every LOL champion has particular strengths and weaknesses. 
When grouped they can combine these strengths to make one of five win conditions. 

1. Teamfighting
2. Splitpush
3. Pick
4. Control
5. Siege

Each of these win conditions has two counters and also counters two other. 
This makes it much like a game of Rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock.
